            <p> UACTF project aims to build a administrative web application for teachers, crimson defense memeber and super admin Dr Atkinson.</p>
            <p>Previously, teachers would reach out to Dr. Atkinson to register their schools and teams, and then Dr. Atkinson kept track of it with manually updated speradsheets. With our application, teachers can register their teams directly from the website, crimson defense memebers can add new challenges for the competition and super admin can oversee the administrative processes to make sure they are running efficiently.</p>
            <p>The app supports dark mode and mobile-friendly layout. App functionality is explained in the video below.</p>
